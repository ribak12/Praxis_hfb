      "Feeling everything doesn't mean you have to carry everything. Witnessing pain is not the same as taking it on. (Buddhism)",
      "Your sensitivity is not a weakness—but your inability to protect it is draining you. Boundaries are compassion for yourself. (Stoicism)",
      "You cannot pour from an empty cup. Prioritizing your energy isn't selfish; it's sustainable. (Self-Care Ethics)",
      "Absorbing others' emotions without permission doesn't help them—it just exhausts you. (Buddhism)",
      "Empathy without boundaries becomes self-destruction. You're allowed to care and still say no. (Stoicism)",
      "You are not responsible for other people's feelings, only for your response to them. (Existentialism)",
      "Feeling deeply is a gift. Losing yourself in others' feelings is not. Know the difference. (Phenomenology)",
      "Sometimes the most loving thing you can do is step back and let people feel their own feelings. (Buddhism)",
      "Your worth isn't measured by how much you give. You're valuable simply by existing. (Humanism)",
      "Carrying others' burdens doesn't lighten their load—it just makes two people weighed down. (Stoicism)",
      "When you feel overwhelmed by others' emotions, ask: 'Is this mine to feel, or am I just holding it?' (Buddhism)",
      "You're allowed to care about someone and still protect your own peace. Both can be true. (Stoicism)",
      "Emotional exhaustion is a signal, not a failure. It means you've given more than you had. Listen to it. (Phenomenology)",
      "People-pleasing isn't kindness—it's fear disguised as care. Real kindness includes honoring yourself. (Existentialism)",
      "You don't need to fix everyone's pain to be valuable. Your presence is enough. (Humanism)",
      "Saying no to others sometimes means saying yes to yourself. That's not selfish—it's necessary. (Stoicism)",
      "When you feel everything everyone else feels, you lose track of what you feel. Check in with yourself first. (Phenomenology)",
      "Empathy is a bridge, not a sponge. You can cross over to understand without absorbing their weight. (Buddhism)",
      "Your emotional bandwidth is finite. Spending it all on others leaves nothing for you. Budget accordingly. (Pragmatism)",
      "You can hold space for someone's pain without making it your own. Distance is not indifference. (Buddhism)",
      "When helping others depletes you, it's not helping—it's harming both of you. Rest is radical. (Self-Care Ethics)",
      "You are not the emotional caretaker of the world. Release that responsibility. (Stoicism)",
      "Compassion includes yourself. If you wouldn't treat a friend the way you treat yourself, adjust. (Buddhism)",
      "Feeling guilty for resting means you've confused your worth with your utility. You are not a tool. (Humanism)",
      "When you can't tell where you end and others begin, it's time to pull back and recalibrate. (Phenomenology)",
      "Your sensitivity allows you to connect deeply—but connection requires two whole people, not one person split in half. (Existentialism)",
      "Protecting your energy isn't cold. It's how you sustain your ability to care long-term. (Stoicism)",
      "You're allowed to feel someone's pain and still choose not to carry it. Empathy doesn't demand martyrdom. (Buddhism)",
      "When you prioritize everyone else, you teach people that you don't matter. Start mattering to yourself. (Existentialism)",
      "You can be deeply caring and still have limits. Limits don't make you less loving—they make you sustainable. (Stoicism)"
