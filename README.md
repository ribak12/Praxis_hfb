Praxis
Daily Emotional Clarity in 2 Minutes

A generative-AI powered spiritual wellness app designed specifically for Gen Z.

Praxis comes from the Greek word πρᾶξις (praxis) — meaning practice or action.
Our philosophy is simple: clarity shouldn’t be a long journey — it should be a daily action.

✨ Overview

Praxis is a lightweight, daily-use emotional wellness app that blends:

Short-term emotional self-awareness

Micro-rituals for grounding

Philosophical guidance

Aesthetic identity snapshots

Light social connection

All powered by Generative AI, delivered in under 2 minutes a day.

Praxis is not therapy, not astrology, and not religious ritual.
It is clarity simplified — a tiny spiritual experience designed for modern youth.

🎯 Problem Statement

Gen Z faces a unique emotional landscape:

Identity instability

Emotional confusion

Digital loneliness

Pressure to “figure themselves out”

Overwhelm from fast-changing environments

But current solutions don’t fit their lifestyle:

Therapy apps → clinical, heavy, long

Journaling apps → effort-intensive

Spiritual/faith apps → ritual-focused, meant for 35+ audiences

There is no fast, modern, daily tool that helps young people understand how they’re feeling today.

Praxis fills this gap.

🌏 Market Opportunity

India’s wellness + spiritual ecosystem is rapidly growing:

$65B in 2024, projected to reach $135B by 2033

Faith-tech apps showing strong traction:

VAMA — 2M+ downloads, 200K paying users

GharMandir — 100K+ downloads

Massive Gen Z and youth adoption potential for emotional/spiritual digital tools

Existing apps focus on devotion and rituals.
Praxis focuses on daily emotional grounding.

🧠 Core Insight: Gen Z & Micro-Identity

Gen Z is obsessed with micro-identities:

MBTI

Zodiac signs

Aesthetic cores

Enneagrams

Short personality quizzes

They don’t want lifelong labels.
They want identity snapshots — small daily mirrors that reflect how they feel today.

Praxis converts that instinct into structured emotional clarity.

⚙️ How Praxis Works

A Praxis session takes under 2 minutes, and follows a simple flow:

1. Dynamic Emotional Questions

150-question emotional bank

Daily selection of 5–7 questions

All answered using a 1–10 Likert scale

This generates 7,900+ crore unique possible combinations

Every day feels unique. Zero repetition.

2. Daily Emotional–Spiritual Archetype

AI computes the user’s short-term archetype using:

Likert scoring

Weighted emotional axes

Temporal context

Archetype mapping logic

The archetype changes daily — matching the fast rhythm of Gen Z emotions.

3. 45-Second Micro-Ritual

Each archetype includes a short grounding ritual:

Breathing techniques

Focus cues

Tiny reflective actions

Designed to be doable anywhere, anytime.

4. Philosophical Guidance

AI pulls from 10 major schools of thought, including:

Taoism

Buddhism

Stoicism

Vedanta

Humanist thought

Zen principles

Each day includes one small guidance sentence — not overwhelming.

5. Emoji Calendar Stamp

After completing the session:

Your archetype is condensed into a single emoji

The emoji is “slammed” onto today’s calendar

Creates a satisfying emotional streak map

This becomes the backbone of user retention.

6. Quiet Social Layer

Users can:

Add friends

See each friend’s daily emoji

No feed, no posts, no likes

Only emotional presence, not performance

A gentle check-in system that reduces social pressure.
